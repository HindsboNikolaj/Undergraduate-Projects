This final project is a conclusion to the semester-long class on Aerodynamics.
Included `in this report is a 2D and 3D analysis of airfoils and wings and a
comparison of methods to do so.` `The target audience of this report would be a
student that has not taken aerodynamics`, so some things will be explained
to a certain degree, but the derivations will be limited, as they were found in previous homework assignments or lectures. Rather, there may be
references to the book or in-class notes where the final step to the derivation is
summarized. In this report, the Thin Airfoil Theory and Vortex Panel Method
were derived for airfoils in a 2D analysis. Further Mach number effects and
Airfoil properties were explored as well as a discussion. Additionally, a 3D
Analysis was done. This analysis included the Lifting Line Theory Elliptic
Solution, Lifting Line Theory General Solution, a discussion of the two, and
then a Taper XFLR ratio discussion. Finally, a wrap-up with aspect ratio
discussion.
