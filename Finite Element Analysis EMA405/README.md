## EMA 405 UW-Madison Intro to Finite Element Analysis

### Homework 1

Underlying FEA Stiffness Matrix theory problems done by hand.

### Homework 2

Used Link180 Elements in Ansys MAPDL to learn how linear varying axial loads affect nodal 
displacements and axial stress and understanding how varying the numbers of elements for the 
same conditions changes the answers. Additionally, this homework assignment explores how to 
use symmetry for a roof truss problem. Both problems are also being modeled in the simulation 
software Ansys. The accuracy of the FE solutions for different numbers of elements are going to 
be compared to analytical answers derived from a finite element analysis approach.

### Homework 3

In this homework question, a frame supports a floor that is subjected to a vertical load. The 
frame is composed of two vertical steel pipe members that support a horizontal I-beam. The task 
was to generate a two-dimensional model for this steel structure using BEAM 189 elements and 
determine the maximum vertical deflection and bending stresses in the portion BC of the frame.

### Homework 4

In this homework question, the task of a new engineer from BadgerDyn Corp. is to design a solid 
round shaft for the pulley-shaft system below. The task of the engineer is to determine the 
minimum size of the shaft that will allow a maximum angle of twist of 0.26 degrees per meter of 
length and deflection of the beam less than 0.005 inches. The material being used is cold-rolled 
1020 steel. In this case, we will do an analytical examination and test it in Ansys to help 
determine the appropriate diameter of the shaft to meet these specifications.

### Homework 5

In this homework, the task is to model the plate pictured below in Figure 1 that is 
subject to axial and normal pressures. The plate is made of 409 stainless steel. The goal is to 
determine the stresses in the plate and use symmetry to reduce the computing power to model the 
plate.

### Homework 6

In this homework question, task is to model the space truss pictured in Figure 1. A space truss 
can be used in space with various functions. The space truss is made of steel with an Elastic 
modulus of 200 GPa, a Poisson’s ratio of 0.3, cross-sectional members of 0.01m^2, and a mass 
density of 7860 kg/m^3.

### Homework 7

In this homework, the task is to model the thick-walled pipe that is subject to an internal 
pressure. We are assuming that the pipe is in plane stress, so that it is a 2D analysis. The pipe has 
a Young’s modulus of 200E9, yield stress of 150E6, and a tangent modulus of 2E9 Pa. A 
Poisson’s ratio of 0.3 is used. Symmetry was used to solve this problem as well.

### Homework 8

In this homework, the model is to task a shrink fit problem, where two circular rings are 
assembled by shrink fit. The outer ring is at a significantly higher temperature (100 C, 20 C) than 
the inner ring when they fit together perfectly, and the model needs to cool until they are at 
equilibrium (defined as 20 degrees C). Using FEA, I determined the final minimum inside radius 
of the assembly. There will be some interference, which is modeled as perfectly bonded (no slip).
This homework was done using `Ansys Workbench - Mechanical`
