# Undergraduate-Projects

A demonstration of the larger projects I did during Undergraduate including in &amp; out of class at UW-Madison from 2019-2023. Notably, I did not include most of my work from Intro classes such as Intro to Python/MATLAB or Computer Science Principles 1-3.

At UW-Madison I studied Engineering Mechanics with a minor in Computer Science.

Omitted are classes that were more heavy in hand-written deliveries. Omitted also, notably, are most of my Computer Science Principles projects, as they were quite backend heavy - just focused on CS Principles
such as polymorphism and implementing data types.
